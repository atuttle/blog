It seems like every time I make a promise to get something done for the community -- Taffy 1.1, bug fixes for a Mango plugin, and now this -- life has a way of making me break that promise. To wit, I was (still am) slammed at work with more than the typical workload. I'm not complaining. Job security is nice, but I feel bad for broken promises.

So here -- better late than never right? -- is my slide deck and notes from my cfObjective 2011 session, [No nonsense RESTful ColdFusion Web Services, with Taffy](http://www.cfobjective.com/index.cfm/sessions/no-nonsense-restful-coldfusion-web-services-with-taffy/).

For those of you who attended my Taffy presentations at [Philly CFUG](http://www.phillycfug.org/) or on [The Online ColdFusion Meetup](http://www.coldfusionmeetup.com), it is mostly the same, but it did evolve a little bit. If you want a refresher, this is the most relevant version to watch.

(Sorry, the website that I used to host these slides has since shuttered and the domain is not relevant any more. So long, SlideSix!)

For the slide notes, you should [download this PDF](/Taffy-1.1-final.pdf), which has the slide at the top of the page, and the notes at the bottom.

Where is the code? You get it when you download [Taffy](http://taffy.io). All of the code that I showed, except for [the "hard way" code I briefly show, which is available here](https://gist.github.com/887610) (link also in the slides), was examples that come in the examples folder of the Taffy download.

Lastly, [Tim Cunningham](http://cfmumbojumbo.com/cf/) was in attendance and kind enough to record my session on video for posterity. I've embedded the two parts below. Thanks, Tim! (Also, thanks for letting me crash on a cot in your room when the hotel gave away my room on Wednesday night!)

Thanks again for coming to my session. It was my first time presenting at a conference, and to get such a positive response was amazing. I hope you got something valuable from it, and I hope to see you at a future event. :)
