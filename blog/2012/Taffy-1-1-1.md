This is a bug-fix release for Taffy 1.1. There were a few issues found with the routing engine, and after much hair pulling and teeth grinding, I'm happy to report that they have been resolved!

So if you're running Taffy 1.1, please upgrade to 1.1.1! The zip is available below, and I will try to get the [Ramen][ramen] installer updated today as well.
