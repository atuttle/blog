Baseball fans hang "K" signs in the stands{class="photo-byline"}

When logging Baseball statistics, a pitcher is given a "K" if they strike out the batter. If the batter doesn't swing at the final pitch, that K is drawn backwards to keep track of "looking" strike outs vs. "swinging" strike outs. The batter's stats also show the K or backwards K if they strike out.

Today while discussing a few stretch goals and moon shots for our company and products, I quipped, "No backwards K's." It took a moment to settle in, but ultimately it was received as a pithy reminder to not go down without a fight. (In this metaphor, yo're the batter.)

It's ok to try and fail. But to fail because you were complacent is embarrassing.
