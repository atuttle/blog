Another post about [Makefiles](/blog/2021/my-ongoing-love-affair-with-gnu-make/)? Sure, why not.

Last time I wrote about how we were doing inheritence with Makefiles, and how I had figured out a way to use curl and a link-shortener (that I control, so I can update the links) to achieve _easy_ updates; but they weren't automatic. And if there's anything that's undeniably true about me in 2021, it's that I have fully embraced the lazy lifestyle.

Remember back when buying stuff online would involve paying extra for shipping, and you had to wait multiple days, sometimes _weeks_ for things to arrive? I have my ethical gripes about Amazon, but I can't deny that Amazon Prime has spoiled me rotten with free 2-day (and sometimes next-day or even same-day) shipping.

Why can't we bring that level of laziness to all aspects of life?
