Very quick note today. As of yesterday, [Semaphore][semaphore] has been removed from [ForgeBox][fb]. [Taffy][taffy] is not far behind.

I have no plans for them to return.

This is entirely for inter-personal reasons, which I don't want to get into here or now. The best summary of the situation is simply that cutting ties is better for my own mental health.

I apologize if this makes it more difficult for you to use Taffy or Semaphore. If you want to be notified of new versions, you might consider subscribing to release notifications on GitHub. Click the "Watch" button in the upper right, then click "Custom" in the list, and select the notifications you want to receive.

Or if that's not your thing, you could use [Follow That Page][ftp] to monitor the [Releases][releases] page.

[taffy]: https://taffy.io/
[semaphore]: https://github.com/atuttle/semaphore
[fb]: https://forgebox.io/

[releases]: https://github.com/atuttle/Taffy/releases
