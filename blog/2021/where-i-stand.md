**My pronouns are he / him / his.** Everyone should be allowed to choose how they want to be addressed.

**Science is real whether or not you agree with it.** Dogma claims to know the truth and must retcon and distort to fit the facts as we learn more about the universe. Science is the act of seeking the truth whether or not it proves your hypothesis wrong, and whether or not it contradicts what we thought to be true last month.

Stop complaining about your sore arm. You're not interesting enough to get a free 5G chip.
