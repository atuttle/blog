Hey there. As it says at the top of the page, my name is Adam Tuttle. This website is my ~~blog~~ [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).

I'm not interested in forcing my personal agenda on anyone, but I do want it to be clear [[2021/where-i-stand | where I stand]] for anyone that wants to know.

Most of what I write on here is technical. In the past I wrote a lot about CFML (ColdFusion Markup Language), but these days it's mostly either JavaScript or more generalized and broadly applicable to most types of coding, or at least web-development.

To feed my family I work at [AlumnIQ][iq]. I could say that I'm the "first hire" but, well, _it's complicated_. There were some people before me, but we were operating under a different name at the time. I joined while we were still operating under that name, and at the time I was the only employee other than the solo-founder. During my tenure we started doing business as AlumnIQ[^1], and we currently operate with a team of 5 people. We've always been 100% remote &mdash;before Covid made it cool&mdash; and we currently span 3 of the 4 (contiguous) US time zones. As for how long and how much I enjoy working at my company, I'll refer you to [[2020/challenge-breeds-stability | my latest work-anniversary entry]].

[^1]: If you ever get the opportunity to name a product or a company, I would advise you to either not use a [portmanteau][portmanteau] or to make peace with your customers and the general public spelling and pronouncing it wrong constantly. Personally, I wouldn't do it again. Yes, the AlumnIQ name idea was mine. As a portmanteau of "Alumni" and "IQ" it's intended to be pronounced "alumni-queue" with no pause between them.

Speaking of my family, we live in suburban Pennsylvania (USA) outside of Philadelphia. We're close enough that we sometimes drive into Philly for a nice dinner, but far enough out that often when the weather is nice and I've got my window open I can hear an amish horse buggy trotting a shortcut through my neighborhood.

I wrote and self-published a book, [ðŸ“˜ REST Assured][rest], about authoring REST API's. It's available both as an e-book and in paperback.

I make a weekly podcast with 3 of my closest tech friends, called [Working Code][wc]. We aim to be a language-agnostic, web-developer-centric, celebration of the everyday triumphs and failures of working as a coder. We want to make your coding career more enjoyable.

I am most active [on Twitter][twitter]. This is mostly tech stuff, too.

When I've got some free time, the thing I most want to do is usually to go skydiving. I have over 500 jumps and I am an instructor and an FAA certificated parachute rigger. I post skydiving videos [on TikTok][tiktok].

Unfortunately, skydiving is a fair-weather sport and the weather isn't always fair. When I can't jump out of airplanes, I can often be found in my basement workshop making furniture out of wood. I document those exploits, to some extent, [on Instagram][insta].

I love to read, and I share my book list [on GoodReads][goodreads]. Science fiction is my genre, and Space Operas are my jam. My current favorite book is [Project Hail Mary][phm] by Andy Weir. I've talked no less than 5 people into reading it and they all reported back that it was so good that they couldn't put it down.

I don't drink much alcohol, but when I do I love trying new beers &ndash; especially IPA's. I track those [on untappd][untappd].
