Given my blog-pivot to my evolution into management, it feels right to open things up by shining a light on the concept of starting new things. I want to look at how I felt on my first day as a newly minted CTO. The elephant in the room is **Imposter Syndrome**.

You can downplay it, if you want. _Sure, I'm the CTO but I'm also literally half of the company. There's nobody under me. Yet._

But consider this: I've yet to see a scenario that you could plausibly find yourself in where your imposter syndrome might actually turn out to be true.

- **New job?** All of the people you interviewed with seem to think you're qualified!
- **First speaking engagement?** You were chosen over probably hundreds of others.
- **Failed to reach a personal goal?** You're ambitious and set challenging goals. No shame there.

You have real value, and your imposter syndrome is anxiety for a future that will probably never come. If you push through that anxiety and do the best you can, you'll probably find that you're doing a great job.

I'm starting to wonder if imposter syndrome is nothing more than a sign that you're pushing yourself to grow. A personal barometer for finding the edge of your comfort zone. If you frame it that way, it becomes a positive thing. A useful tool on your belt.

Imposter syndrome is real, and the way it makes you feel can really affect you. But just like stubbing a toe in the dark, if you choose to accept it and move on with your life, you'll still get to where you were going.
