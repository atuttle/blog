Did I make a typo or a spelling mistake? [Your PR's to fix my goofs are super appreciated!](https://github.com/atuttle/blog/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## ToDo

Waiting until stuff is 100% polished before release isn't any fun. So there are a few rough edges. Here's some stuff I still need to do:

1. Fix backlinks hover display for when I link to my old articles
2. Finish index search/filter stuff
3. ~~Import & refurbish old content~~
