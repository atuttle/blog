# About Me

I'm the CTO of [AlumnIQ][iq], but we're a pretty small company so I wear many hats: coder, humane interface designer, and technical debt herder to name a few. I identify as Philadelphian, but I live in the suburbs.

I joined AlumnIQ as employee #2 in 2012, where I have become the CTO and Lead developer, shaping and building technology that aims to revolutionize Higher Education Advancement, and Alumni Relations. In my time here, I've helped grow the company from two people to five.

I've been working from home full time since before COVID-19 made that commonplace. We're a geographically distributed, 100% remote team. I have a strange addiction to collecting board games even though we don't play them as much as I'd like.

## Interests

As a (borderline) millennial I am contractually obligated to pepper at least 70% of my life into social media profiles.

- I have a [weekly podcast][podcast] about working as a coder
- I [skydive][skydive]
- I make things [from wood][woodworking]
- I wrote [a book about REST][book]
- I [read a fair amount][goodreads]
- and I have a wife and 2 kids that occasionally tolerate my presence. We like to:
  - üé¢ Ride rollercoasters
  - üéÆ Play video games
  - üé≤ Play tabletop games
  - üèïÔ∏è Go camping
  - üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Go hiking

I love traveling, whether it be for work, to attend or speak at an event, for destination-skydiving, or just plain old vacationing.

I've lived on all three Continental American coasts, and [The Azores][azores].

My dog is named after a character from Futurama.

I've called 911 in two different emergency situations. One of them was for my brother.

I swam a mile, camped in deep snow, hiked some parts of the Appalachain Trail and different parts of Redwood National and State Parks. I've never been to the Grand Canyon. I can tie a bowline knot with one hand.

I remember attending six different schools up to and including high school, but it might have been more.

My favorite book genre is hard science fiction and my favorite author is Andy Weir (OMG have you read [Project Hail Mary][phm]?!). Space operas are my _JAM!_

Speaking of books, I wrote and self-published a book: [REST Assured][book]. If you use or build APIs, it might interest you.
