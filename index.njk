<h1>üëã Hey. I'm Adam.</h1>
<p>I write code, jump out of airplanes, make stuff from wood, and write about all of that stuff here.
Mostly the code, though.</p>

<p>I'm the CTO of <a href="https://www.alumniq.com">AlumnIQ</a>, but we're a pretty small company so I
wear many hats: coder, humane interface designer, and technical debt herder to name a few.
I used to blog more often, but that was before I fell in love with both woodworking
and skydiving. I identify as Philadelphian, but I live in the suburbs.</p>

<h2>More about me</h2>

<p>Socially, I'm most active on <a href="https://twitter.com/adamtuttle">Twitter</a>. I use
<a href="https://github.com/atuttle">GitHub</a> daily, but mostly for work these days. Still, I can be
found putzing around in open source as needed and as my interests motivate. I have two Instagram accounts,
for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alteregowoodworks/">woodworking</a>, and
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/adamtuttle/">skydiving</a>). When  time allows, I also like to read,
so you can see what I've been reading over on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7514385.Adam_Tuttle">GoodReads</a>.
I am a devout believer in the oxford comma.</p>

<p>I joined <a href="https://alumniq.com/">AlumnIQ</a> as employee #2 in 2012, where I have become the CTO and
Lead developer, shaping and building technology that aims to revolutionize Higher Education Advancement, and
Alumni Relations. In my time here, I've helped grow the company from two people to five.</p>

<p>I work from home on a geographically distributed, 100% remote team, which means that on most days I get the
privilege of making breakfast and lunch for my two children. I have a strange addiction to collecting board games
even though we don't play them as much as I'd like.</p>

<p>In more recent years I've found that I love woodworking, so when I'm not coding or falling out of various
aircraft you'll most often find me in my basement turning wood into things.</p>

<p>I love traveling, whether it be for work, to attend or speak at an event, or vacationing. I've lived on all
three Continental American coasts, and <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@38.6903073,-27.9664891,8.98z">The Azores</a>.
My dog is named after a character from Futurama. I've called 911 in two different emergency situations. One of
them was for my brother. I swam a mile, camped in deep snow, hiked some parts of the Appalachain Trail and
different parts of Redwood National and State Parks. I've never been to the Grand Canyon. I remember attending
six different schools up to and including high school, but it might have been more. I can tie a bowline knot
with one hand. My favorite author is Bill Bryson, but my favorite book genre is hard science fiction.
Space operas are my jam.</p>

<p>Speaking of books, I wrote and self-published a book: <a href="https://restassuredbook.com">REST Assured</a>‚Äî
and I did it over the course of two weeks, after work. If you use or build APIs, it might interest you.</p>
