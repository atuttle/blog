I have heard of "digital gardening" many times over the last few years, but it wasn't until I ran across [Joel Hooks' explanation of the thoughts behind his own digital garden][jhgarden] that it really clicked for me. So, inspired by that entry, I am undertaking to convert my own blog into a digital garden.

I will try to explain it in my own words, but Joel did such a great job that you really should just [go read his explanation][jhgarden] and not mine.

## For You

The way that people consume content on the internet has changed. Gone are the days (well, mostly) of subscribing to a bunch of blogs in your RSS reader and pretending to read every article by every person you follow but actually only really taking the time to read a select few with your _actual_ focus and your _actual_ attention. ~~Sorry, what? I got distracted watching TikTok.~~

Most of the stuff you read online you probably found via a link on social media, or perhaps from a search engine. Then what is the value in presenting it chronologically? It's rare that there is a long series of related entries and viewing them one after the other adds value. We can probably agree that tagging is more useful than chronology when it comes to helping readers find additional content they might want to read.

In some ways I'm trying to organize my digial garden to cater to that aspect of **your reading journey**. I have always made an effort to link between my articles where relevant opportunities present themselves in the prose. I've got some ideas brewing about using my [tags][tags] to help surface related content, but that's just my coder's brain doing what coder brain's do: enumerating solutions whether or not I want it to.

If you land here from a social media link and find the article interesting, your next step is probably to proceed to [the homepage][atc] to see what else might interest you. While things I've written recently could be somewhat relevant, you would probably get more value from a curated list of my favorite articles. So I also intend to curate my favorite entries onto the [root of my site][atc]. Why should it be beholden to things I've written _lately_? The Greatest Hits are the Greatest Hits for a reason, right?

## For Me

I have been blogging off-and-on for my entire adult life. Technical difficulties notwithstanding, I've been writing on this tech blog frequently (if not regularly) since 2007. This is the 3rd domain that I can recall it using. I don't even remember the original URL -- that's how long ago it was. Eventually I moved it to <strong>FusionGrokker.com</strong>, and later, feeling that the domain was painting me into a corner I didn't want to occupy, I moved it to **AdamTuttle.codes**.<sup>1</sup>

That's a lot of content, and so almost by default, the only organizational method that seems possible is chronological. Indeed, it can be fun to crawl through the archives and pluck out things that are interesting in hindsight specifically _because of the moment in time they occupied_. For example, [on episode 36 of my podcast Working Code][wcp], we discussed blogging and so we dug up our first few blog posts to have a laugh at ourselves and at how much things have changed since then. [Here's my first post.][first-post] ðŸ˜‚

But relying on the passage of time to organize your thoughts is a lazy approach. And it's unhelpful.

One of the things I mentioned on the podcast was that just like a real garden, a digital garden can help you grow just like you can help it grow. If I'm serious about my garden helping me grow as much as I help it, then I'm going to have to put more thought into it than the lazy default. I have to pull the weeds, prune the dead branches, and occasionally test the soil pH.

It's like going to the gym on a regular schedule, but instead of toning my muscles I'll be organizing my thoughts.

In addition to the **personal growth** aspect and the **organizational** aspect, I also really like the idea of stepping away from "performative" blogging. Much of what I wrote on my blog from 2007 to 2011 accomplished what I was hoping for at the time &mdash; even though I didn't realize that's what I was doing. It built a sort of personal brand, which served as a vehicle for career growth and community recognition. People started to know my name and that helped me get better jobs. As weird as it is to think this way, my career perspective now is closer to "late stage." I'm happy where I am and there's every reason to believe I could be here until I retire. I wouldn't mind getting paid to make conference presentations, but that's not the target I'm aiming for.

I hope that this format shift helps me feel freer to experiment with writing topics. I want to go back and present a concise summary of my thoughts on [Clean Code][cc], and I want to take the time to read [TDD By Example][tdd] (and write about it).

As for the comments section... I'm not sure what to do with it. After reincarnation at AdamTuttle.codes comment traffic is much lower than it used to be, and this parallels what I've heard from some other friends who blog. Maybe it's time for comments to shutter; at least in their current form?

I've seen some blogs that display Tweets that mention the article in lieu of comments. That seems interesting. I know that not everybody is on Twitter but for what it's worth some people get blocked from using Disqus by their corporate firewalls, too. Is the comments section important to you? Leave one below and let me know. Or maybe [tweet at me][twitter] instead. (Be sure to include a link here in case I setup that integration. ðŸ˜‚)
