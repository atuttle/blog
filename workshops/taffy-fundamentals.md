This is a four hour, online workshop for CFML developers who know little-to-nothing about writing REST API's with [Taffy](https://taffy.io), and want to get up to speed in a day.

You don't need to be a CFML expert, but having a basic understanding of the following concepts will give you a great start:

- Application.cfc and its lifecycle methods (`onRequestStart`, etc)
- Component inheritance (`extends="foo.bar"`)
- CFML Mappings (optional, but useful)

The workshop heavily uses exercises that you will complete on your own computer, and does not include time in the schedule for troubleshooting installation issues. You are expected to arrive for the workshop with a functional CFML environment, and a functioning Taffy installation. (Coming soon: a docker container ready to go!)

## After this workshop, you will know how to...{style="font-size:1.953em"}

- Create and update API resources
- Plan and implement a clean URI scheme
- Use Taffy's dashboard to explore and debug your API
- Generate documentation from your API by adding hint attributes
- Use multiple caching mechanisms to maximize performance
- Eliminate code duplication using inheritance and dependency injection
- Return data in a clean and standards-compliant way without duplicating render code
- Inspect requests and responses to enforce security and auditing
- Deal with and avoid URI collisions
- Remove Taffy branding from the dashboard & make it safe to share with consumers
- Configure environment-specific setting overrides
- Create custom (de-)serializers so that your API can "speak" more than just JSON
- Secure your API
  - Block unidentified access and unauthorized requests from identified users
  - Audit all activity
  - Expire and Revoke API keys
  - HTTP Basic Auth over SSL
  - Why you probably shouldn't use JWT

While I have taught this workshop to a small audience already, it is still a little rough around the edges. You should expect to learn a lot but be prepared to laugh ~~at me~~ with me as I work out the kinks in front of a live studio audience.

You'll be given multiple opportunities to provide feedback, and your feedback will be used to shape the workshop for future attendees. Please come prepared to give your best constructive criticism!

In addition, class sizes will be kept small (<= 10 people) during beta workshops, to help keep everything under control.

## Cost{style="font-size:1.953em"}

Cost will be $1,000 USD per seat. Discounts will be available for multiple seats (send your entire team!), and for referrals. I would like to offer [purchasing power parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity) if I can find a way to do it well.

## Date and time{style="font-size:1.953em"}

I haven't yet identified any dates/times to hold this workshop. That will depend on where you're located. For example, if we can get an entire class together in the UK/EU, I'll schedule something at a reasonable time in those time zones.

**Most courses will be scheduled on weekends.** Teaching is not my primary job so I have to fit it into my free time.

To help me schedule workshops at a time that works well for you, and to help me get in touch with you when I've got a workshop _in your time_ (is that a thing we say about online-international events?), I'll need you to do two things:

1. Sign up for this email list, below; and
2. Fill out the survey it shows you when you click the link in the confirmation email.
