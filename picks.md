# Picks

A collection of stuff I love and would recommend to anyone.

## Apps

- Anti-pick: Stop using **PocketCasts** for podcasts. It's owned by Automattic, and their CEO [Matt Mullenweg has gone off the deep end](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/12/wordpress-vs-wp-engine-drama-explained/). I don't love it, but I've been using [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/) for podcasts since quitting PocketCasts.

- [MacroFactor](https://macrofactorapp.com/) - Like MyFitnessPal, but better. $71.99/year. Log your food and your weight and it calculates your TDEE and helps you set dietary parameters based on your goals and lifestyle. Super accurate, easy and fast to use. Very customizable. Worth it if you're trying to lose weight or build muscle.

- <img src="/img/picks/strong_app.png" class="hoverZoom" />[Strong](https://www.strong.app/) - This is what I use to plan and track my workouts. It's free to get started. If you want to add a bunch of custom workout plans then it's $29.99/year. I like it because it combines workout routines with history of previous workouts (e.g. it remembers that I used 25lb dumbbells for this lift last time, and I did 3 sets of 10 with the different RPE values I logged for each set), and customizable rest timers, and weight plate calculator. Small price to pay to avoid having to bring a spreadsheet to the gym with you.
