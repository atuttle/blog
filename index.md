# Yo! I'm Adam

![Photo of Adam Tuttle][gravatar]{class="headshot"} I make stuff on the internet, but as you can tell from... _\*gestures broadly\*_ ... I am not a designer.

You've found yourself at the root node of my [digital garden](/notes). I am a life-long-learner and I believe that sharing what you learn is a great way to crystalize the lessons for yourself, so I write about my learnings here. I fancy myself a decent writer, and these electrons are being terribly inconvenienced to prop up that fantasy.

In addition to tech, I have a variety of other interests including skydiving, woodworking, and podcasting. [For the curious, I've obliged with some detail about myself here](/notes/2021/about-me/).

### Working Code Podcast

One of my (many) hobbies is podcasting. I co-host the [Working Code Podcast][wcp], a language-agnostic web-development focused podcast with the goal of celebrating the triumphs and fails of a career in software, and making your coding career more enjoyable. New episodes every Wednesday!
