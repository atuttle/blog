# Yo! I'm Adam.

![Photo of Adam Tuttle][gravatar]{class="headshot"} I make stuff on the internet, but as you can tell from... _\*gestures broadly\*_ ... I am not a designer.

You've found yourself at the root node of my [digital garden][garden]. I am a life-long-learner and I believe that sharing what you learn is a great way to crystalize the lessons for yourself, so I write about my learnings here. I fancy myself a decent writer, and these electrons are being terribly inconvenienced to prop up that fantasy.
