Hey there, and thanks for your help.

As a human being, from time to time I am bound to make mistakes. Often those include spelling, punctuation, grammar, and other typos. If you see anything inaccurate in [my blog/digital-garden][blog], please feel free to submit a pull request to address it.

In fact, content pull requests of this type are a fantastic way to [dip your toes into learning how to create and use pull requests][make], if you've never done it before.

For the safety and wellbeing of everyone, please be aware that we will expect you to abide by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
