A living document of the tools, software, and hardware I use daily.

There won't be a section for this, so I'll just say here that I use **[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/adamtuttle.codes)** as my primary public social media. I quit Twitter when Musk bought and ruined it. I only begrudgingly use Facebook.
