I've been contacted by a recruiter from [Fusion Alliance](http://www.fusionalliance.com/) about a job opening where they're looking for someone to do ColdFusion programming with Taffy and Mura. It sounds like working remotely is an option, but in case you're in the area the customer site is in Dayton, Ohio.

I don't know much about the project aside from the fact that it will be using both Mura and Taffy -- that and their target delivery date is at the end of June.
