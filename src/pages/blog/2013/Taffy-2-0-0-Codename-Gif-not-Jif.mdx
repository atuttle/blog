It only took 3 years, but Taffy 2.0 is finally here. If you attended [Office Hours][1] last week, you got a sneak peek at the updated dashboard UI. Now you can use it yourself!

{image lost to the annals of the internet, sorry!}

In the past (e.g. [Version 1.3][3]) I have detailed the release notes here on my blog; but that was before GitHub added their fancy new "Releases" feature for doing just that. So this time, instead of listing everything here, I'll point you to the official [Taffy 2.0 release notes][2]. Please do read them, as there are some significant changes between versions 1.3 and 2.0, as you probably expect.

As discussed when I released version 1.3, I'm aiming for smaller, more frequent builds; on the order of 2 or 3 releases per year. As such, 2.0 is mostly a maintenance release with a new coat of paint. Aside from the visual redesign of the dashboard, the only new feature is JSONP support. It also includes 8 bug fixes, and everything previously deprecated has been removed.

As always, I offer my sincerest thanks to everyone involved with Taffy in any way, shape, or form. Every single bug report, feature request, support request, mailing list thread, tweet and blog post honestly warms my heart.

I still have big plans for improving the framework, the documentation, and the experience of forking and sending a pull request, so stay tuned!
