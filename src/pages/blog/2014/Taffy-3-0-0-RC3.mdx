Today I've published [Taffy 3.0.0-RC3](https://github.com/atuttle/Taffy/releases/tag/v3.0.0-RC3), which I expect to be the final Release Candidate build for the final 3.0.0 release. Just a few small bug fixes went into this update, and unless anyone reports any issues with this build it will become the official 3.0.0 build some time next week.

There have been _many_ changes between 2.x and 3.0, a few of which will require some minor updates to your code, so if you're upgrading please familiarize yourself with the [breaking changes](http://docs.taffy.io/3.0.0/#Breaking-Changes) first.
