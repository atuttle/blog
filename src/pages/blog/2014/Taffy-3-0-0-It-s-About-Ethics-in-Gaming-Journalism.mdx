We did it! Taffy 3.0.0 is here.

<a href="https://github.com/atuttle/Taffy/archive/v3.0.0.zip" class="btn btn-success" style="text-decoration:none">Download Taffy 3.0.0</a>

As I mentioned with each Release Candidate, there are a few [Breaking Changes][breaking] &mdash; things you will have to change in your API code if you upgrade Taffy. I've documented what each of them is in the new [Breaking Changes][breaking] section of the documentation, and not to worry: They're all pretty trivial. Just changing a few base classes and stuff like that.

You can also see a [full detailed list of all bug fixes and new features in the documentation][docs].

As ever, my immense thanks go out to everyone that contributed to this release; and there are many of you! I've added your GitHub avatars to the bottom of [taffy.io](http://taffy.io) as a thank you!
