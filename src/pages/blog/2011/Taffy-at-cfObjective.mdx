I'll be leaving in just a few short hours to fly to Minneapolis and attend [cfObjective 2011](http://www.cfobjective.com).

In case you didn't already know, I'll be presenting on creating REST web services with ColdFusion, and of course, [Taffy](http://taffy.riaforge.org). [My session](http://www.cfobjective.com/index.cfm/sessions/no-nonsense-restful-coldfusion-web-services-with-taffy/) is **Friday morning at 10:15, in ballroom D3**.

If my laptop battery holds out during my flights, I should be able to finish the last few tasks in time to release Taffy 1.1 at my presentation on Friday morning. Cross your fingers. (If not, it should be within a week or two!)

While I'm babbling about Taffy, I'll also mention that I've created a Google Group for it. It's kind of hard for me to believe, but adoption has been steadily increasing and I am no longer able to respond to every Taffy-related email I get in a timely manner. I'm hoping that users can help each other out via the group -- and of course we'll discuss best practices and the future of the framework there, too.
